# ZWOASITest
Very simple project that accesses the ASI ZWO astro camera connected and tries to download a frame.
My ASI094MC Pro failed on that, so my first idea was a software issue, but sadly it was hardware ....
But with this very simple software you can be sure it is not a software interoperation issue
